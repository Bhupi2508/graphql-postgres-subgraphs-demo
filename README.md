# GraphQL Apollo Federation Demo

This is a demo project showcasing a GraphQL API integrated with PostgreSQL, with a focus on subgraph modularization using Apollo Federation. Learn how to create, manage, and integrate subgraphs for improved GraphQL API organization and scalability.

## Overview

GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs, but as your API grows, it can become challenging to manage a monolithic GraphQL schema. Apollo Federation offers a solution by allowing you to break down your GraphQL service into smaller subgraphs that can be developed independently and later composed into a unified API.

This project provides an example of how to set up an Apollo Federation-based GraphQL API with PostgreSQL as the data source. You can use this project as a starting point for your own federated GraphQL services.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhupi2508/graphql-postgres-subgraphs-demo.git

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd graphql-postgres-subgraphs-demo
npm install
Set up your PostgreSQL database and configure the connection in src/db.js.

Define your GraphQL subgraph schemas and resolvers in the src/ directory.

Update the src/gateway-entry.js file to specify how your subgraphs should be composed.

Start the gateway server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

src/: Contains the source code for subgraph services and the gateway.
src/db.js: Configuration for connecting to your PostgreSQL database.
src/gateway-entry.js: Entry point for the Apollo Federation gateway.
Schema/: Define your GraphQL type definitions (schemas) here.
Resolver/: Implement your GraphQL resolvers here.
Apollo Federation
Apollo Federation is a set of tools and techniques for building federated GraphQL services. It offers several benefits:

Modularity: Divide your GraphQL schema into smaller subgraphs that can be developed and deployed independently.

Scalability: Easily add or update subgraph services to scale your system horizontally.

Entity Composition: Define entities and relationships between subgraphs to compose data from different sources.

Microservices Architecture: Aligns with microservices principles, allowing you to manage different domains or functionalities as separate services.

Usage
This project provides a starting point for setting up Apollo Federation with GraphQL and PostgreSQL. Customize the subgraph schemas and resolvers to suit your specific use case.

Define your GraphQL subgraphs in the Schema/ directory.

Implement resolvers for your subgraphs in the Resolver/ directory.

Update the gateway configuration in src/gateway-entry.js to specify how subgraphs are composed.

Start the gateway server with npm start.

Access the GraphQL API at http://localhost:4000/graphql.
